/* Write a higher-order function that takes a value, a test function, an update function, and a body function. Each iteration, it first runs the test functionon the current loop value and stops if that returns false. Then it calls the body function, giving it the current value. Finally, it calls the update function to create a new value and starts from the begining. When defining the function, you can use a regular loop to do the actual looping. */
